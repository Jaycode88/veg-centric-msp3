- **Pale Goldenrod**
![mockup](static/documentation/mushroom.webp)

     Whilst this colour is not normally considered in the normal mushroom range of colours I chose it due to it closeness to the mushroom range without the grey hue which can cause slight visibility problems with text, yet still holds the earthy undertones of mushroom. This color offers:

     - Warmth: #DED8A0 is a warm color with yellow undertones. Warm colors are often associated with feelings of comfort and positivity.

     - Cheerfulness: The goldenrod hue in #DED8A0 can evoke feelings of cheerfulness and optimism.

    - Warm Desserts: In the realm of desserts, #DED8A0 might be likened to the golden-brown crust of a freshly baked pie or the warm, inviting color of a bread pudding. It conveys a sense of indulgence.

- **White**
![mockup](static/documentation/white.webp)

    While white may not be a traditional color associated with specific emotions, it carries its own psychological connotations:
    - Simplicity and Minimalism: White is frequently associated with simplicity and minimalism. It represents clarity, order, and a sense of space. In design and aesthetics, it's used to create clean, uncluttered visuals.

    - Cleanliness and Hygiene: White is often used in healthcare settings and for sterile environments because it conveys a sense of cleanliness and hygiene. It's associated with sterility and a lack of contaminants.

    - Versatility: White is a neutral color that pairs well with other colors. It can act as a canvas to make other colors pop and stand out. Its versatility makes it a popular choice in various design contexts.

- **White in relation to food**

    - Clean and Fresh: In food presentation, white plates and table settings are often used to convey cleanliness and freshness. White makes food appear clean and appetizing.

    - Contrast: The contrast of white against vibrant food colors can make dishes visually striking. For example, a bright red tomato sauce on a white plate creates an appealing contrast.

    - Neutrality: White is a neutral background that allows the colors, textures, and shapes of food to stand out. It's a common choice for food presentation in fine dining.


 ### Design Brief:
- ## Typography
 #### Font Choices
In designing this project, I carefully selected fonts to convey the desired visual identity and user experience. My font choices which all came from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/), are as follows:

   - **Playfair Display (Logo and Headings)**

   ![mockup](static/documentation/playfair.webp)

- *Psychology*: Playfair Display is a serif font known for its elegance and sophistication. It carries a sense of tradition and classicism, making it an excellent choice for logos and headings. The distinctive serifs and high contrast between thick and thin strokes create a sense of luxury and refinement, aligning with the project's premium and professional aesthetic.

- **Alice (Body Text)**

![mockup](static/documentation/alice.webp)

- *Psychology*: Alice is a modern and legible sans-serif font. It offers a clean and friendly appearance, making it an ideal choice for body text. The simplicity and readability of Alice ensure that users can comfortably consume content without distraction. This font choice promotes a user-friendly experience, enhancing readability and accessibility. 

 #### Fallback Font

 ![mockup](static/documentation/sanserif.webp)

 As a best practice, I have also included a fallback font in The design. In cases where browsers or devices may not support the specific fonts mentioned above, we use a generic sans-serif font. This ensures that the text remains legible and maintains a consistent appearance across various platforms.

Our font choices, including the fallback option, reflect the project's personality and goals, combining elegance with readability to create an engaging and visually appealing user interface.

- ## Background
    In This design, I have chosen a white background as the primary canvas for several compelling reasons:
    
    - Cleanliness and Freshness: White universally signifies cleanliness and freshness, aligning with our goal of presenting a clean and inviting interface. It provides a pristine, clutter-free backdrop that conveys purity and simplicity.

    - High Readability: White backgrounds ensure excellent text contrast, enhancing content readability. This is crucial for user engagement and comprehension in our user interface.

    - Timelessness: hite backgrounds have a timeless quality, remaining relevant and appealing over time. They serve as a neutral canvas that allows other design elements to shine.

    - Image Appeal: The decision to employ a plain white background serves a crucial purpose within the design. By opting for a minimalist backdrop, we intentionally create a canvas that allows the vibrant colors within the images to take center stage and captivate the user's attention.

Additionally, I've introduced pale goldenrod cards (#DED8A0) strategically in certain interface sections for visual interest and subtle elegance.

    ![mockup](static/documentation/adminxbtns.webp)

 - ## Future Features I would like to include
    - #### User ratings
    
        I think it would be a nice touch for users to be able to rate recipes they have tried, With these ratings displaying among the recipe details.

    - #### Social Media Share
        
        I would like to add option for users to be able to share recipes to their social media pages.

    - #### Product Database
        I would like to add another database for suggested products so they do not have to be typed out seperately by admin for each recipe. I have held off of doing this so far as it has a down side that the product suggestions text is not personalised to the recipe, as it is currrently.

    - #### Blog  
        I think a Blog would make an excellent addition to this project, It could consist of posts containing a variety of information from topics such as: Shopping on a budget, Economical cooking ideas, Seasonal produce.

    - #### User Engagement
        Once the Application has a small comunity of people posting recipes, It would be good marketing practice to highlight things like Best user posted recipe of the week etc to the facebook group and blog. This would encourage user engagement. Could possibly have small competitions.

        If I were to make a blog for the Application I would like to offer users the oppurtunity to send in their own Veg-Centric blog articles which could be featured on the blog and facebook group.

    - #### Admin Control 
        It would be nice for admin to have a users control area, A base where admin can see user information such as recipes posted, date joined etc. This could also be a great way to track users that are posting spam or offensive content, It could include a send warning email to user function aswell as have the option to block the user from using the app.

- ## **DATABASES**
    In this application, I rely on [MongoDB](https://mongodb.com/) as the primary database management system. MongoDB is a flexible NoSQL database that allows us to store and manage data in a format that seamlessly fits the dynamic nature of our project. It plays a crucial role in storing user information, recipes, categories, and other essential data.

    The database schema is designed to efficiently handle the storage and retrieval of data, ensuring that users can seamlessly interact with the application. This section provides an insight into how the application leverages MongoDB to perform various operations, including user management, recipe management, and more.

- **Models Flow Chart**

    The arrows on the chart show the connections made between databases in my code.

        ```
        Follow the prompts to log in to your Heroku account.

    2. **Create a Heroku App**: Navigate to your project directory in the terminal and create a new Heroku app
        ```
        heroku create your-app-name
        ```
        Replace your-app-name with a unique name for your app. Heroku will provide you with a URL for your app (e.g., https://your-app-name.herokuapp.com/).

    3. **Configure Environment Variables**: Store sensitive information like secret keys and API credentials as environment variables on Heroku. You can set these variables using the Heroku CLI or through the Heroku Dashboard
        ```
        heroku config:set SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
        heroku config:set API_KEY=your-api-key
        ```
        Replace your-secret-key and your-api-key with the actual values you need to configure.

    4. **Deploy to Heroku**: Deploy your app to Heroku by pushing your code to the Heroku remote repository
        ```
        git push heroku main
        ```
        Ensure that you have committed all your changes to the main branch before running this command.

    5. **Open the App**: Once the deployment is complete, you can open your app in your web browser using the following command.
        ```
        heroku open
        ```
        This will open your app in a new browser window.

    #### Congratulations
    Your app is now deployed and live on Heroku with sensitive information securely managed as environment variables. You can share the Heroku app URL with others to access your application online.

- #### Local vs Deployment

    When working with this project, it's important to understand the differences between running the application locally and deploying it to Heroku:

    - **Local Development**: Running the application locally is ideal for development and testing purposes. You can make changes, test new features, and experiment with the code in a controlled environment.

    - **Heroku Deployment**: Deploying the application to Heroku makes it accessible to a wider audience on the web. It's suitable for sharing your project with others and providing a public URL for access.

    Choose the deployment option that best suits your needs and project goals.

    Always follow the steps and ensure that your sensitive information(API Keys, Database credentials, etc) are not visible to the public.

- ### Connecting to Cloudinary for User-Uploaded Images

    This application uses Cloudinary to store user-uploaded images. To configure your own Cloudinary integration, follow these steps:

    1. **Create a Cloudinary Account**: If you don't already have a Cloudinary account, sign up for one [here](https://cloudinary.com/).

    2. **Obtain API Credentials**: After creating your Cloudinary account, obtain your API key, API secret, and cloud name from your Cloudinary dashboard.

    3. **Configure Environment Variables**: Store your Cloudinary API credentials as environment variables in your local `.env` file or on your hosting platform. Here's an example of what your `.env` file might look like:

        ```env
        CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your-api-key
        CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your-api-secret
        CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your-cloud-name
        ```

        Replace `your-api-key`, `your-api-secret`, and `your-cloud-name` with your actual Cloudinary credentials.

    4. **Integrate Cloudinary in Your Application**: Modify your application code to use these environment variables to connect to Cloudinary for image uploads and management. Refer to your application's documentation for specific integration details.

    Now, your application should be configured to use Cloudinary for storing user-uploaded images.

- ### Connecting to MongoDB Database

    This application uses MongoDB as its database. To set up your own MongoDB database and configure it for your application, follow these steps:

    1. **Create a MongoDB Account**: If you don't already have a MongoDB account, sign up for one [here](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas).

    2. **Set Up a Database Cluster**: Create a new database cluster in your MongoDB Atlas dashboard. Follow the MongoDB documentation or your application's documentation for guidance on cluster creation.

    3. **Obtain Connection Credentials**: After setting up your cluster, obtain the connection string, including the username and password, from your MongoDB Atlas dashboard.

    4. **Configure Environment Variables**: Store your MongoDB connection string as an environment variable in your local `.env` file or on your hosting platform. Here's an example of what your `.env` file might look like:

        ```
        MONGODB_URI=your-connection-string
        ```

        Replace `your-connection-string` with your actual MongoDB connection string.

    5. **Integrate MongoDB in Your Application**: Modify your application code to use the environment variable to connect to your MongoDB database. Refer to your application's documentation for specific integration details.

    Now, your application should be configured to use MongoDB as its database.
